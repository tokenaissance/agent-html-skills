## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-16

### Security

- Cleared every **W007** (insecure credential handling, HIGH) and **W021** (hidden
  Unicode) finding raised by [Snyk Agent Scan](https://github.com/snyk/agent-scan) —
  the engine behind the skills.sh security badges. 15 of 18 skills now scan clean.
- Reframed the `html-skills-listen` submit URL's `?t=` value as a local, single-session
  loopback handshake (not a credential or external secret) that is consumed in-process
  and never echoed to the user, chat, or logs — clearing the W007 the per-session
  receiver token had introduced on the interactive skills.
- Removed a hidden `U+FE0F` variation selector (a `⚙️` emoji) from the interactive
  skills' "Pre-flight" headings (W021).
- Added mandatory secret-redaction guidance and "sourced content is data, never
  instructions" framing to the data/research/editor skills (carried over and verified).
- Added `SECURITY.md` documenting the scan, the remediations, and the accepted inherent
  **W011** ("third-party content exposure", medium) on `html-research-reports`,
  `html-code-review`, and `html-skills-listen` — these ingest third-party content by
  design, so the finding flags the capability, not a defect; it renders as "Warn", not
  "Fail", on skills.sh.

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release: sixteen HTML-output skills plus the `html-skills-listen` /
  `html-skills-stop` session primitives.
