# html-skills

Sixteen Claude Code skills for HTML-output patterns — derived from Thariq's article ["Using Claude Code: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of HTML"](https://x.com/trq212/status/2052809885763747935).

## Design notes

- **Skills are markdown-only; runtime assets are plugin-level**, not per-skill. The skills are about communication patterns and aesthetic guidance, not deterministic transforms; a single `SKILL.md` is the right shape. The shared submit receiver (`server.js`, bundled with the `html-skills-listen` skill) and the submit-handler JS (`assets/submit-handler.js`) live at the plugin root and are referenced by every interactive skill — see "Submit pipeline" below.
- **Pushy descriptions** — each frontmatter `description` is written to fight Claude's tendency to undertrigger. They include explicit phrases ("brainstorm", "compare", "diagram") so the skill triggers even when the user doesn't say "HTML".
- **Common foundation, repeated** — every `SKILL.md` ends with a `## HTML output foundation` block restating the non-negotiable rules (single file, mobile-responsive, no `localStorage`, real semantic HTML, deliberate aesthetic, accessible, print-ready). This is intentional: skills are loaded independently, so each carries the foundation.
- **No `localStorage`** — Claude.ai artifacts can't use browser storage. State lives in memory; persistence is the export button. Skills that include export buttons say so explicitly.

## Submit pipeline for interactive artifacts

Six skills produce artifacts the user submits back: `html-throwaway-editor`, `html-mind-map`, `html-brainstorm-grid`, `html-comparison-matrix`, `html-interactive-playground`, `html-design-prototypes`. Each of those `SKILL.md` files ends with a `## Submit pipeline (server or clipboard)` block describing the contract.

### Two modes

| Mode | Setup | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Server** (default in local Claude Code) | Agent invokes the `html-skills-listen` skill from each interactive skill's pre-flight block — it returns a per-session URL like `http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-port>/?t=<session-token>`. The agent injects `window.__CLAUDE_SUBMIT_URL__ = '<that URL>'` into each artifact at generation time, exactly as returned — the `?t=` token authenticates submits; never strip the query string. Submit POSTs JSON there; agent gets a `Monitor` notification — no copy-paste. | Agent is in a local Claude Code session with shell access. Almost always you when there's a real terminal. |
| **Clipboard** (fallback) | None. Artifact inlines `assets/submit-handler.js` and calls `submitToClaude(payload)`. Submit copies JSON; user pastes back. | `html-skills-listen` reported it can't run (cloud / web / sandboxed harness), or the harness has no `Monitor`-equivalent. Always works, but every submit costs the user a paste. |

The decision rule for agents is one line: *before writing each interactive artifact*, invoke the `html-skills-listen` skill (it's idempotent). It self-detects cloud/web/sandboxed environments and short-circuits when server mode can't reach the browser, so it's always safe to run. If it reports active, use server mode for every artifact this session. If it short-circuited, drop to clipboard. Server mode falls through to clipboard if a POST fails for any reason, so the user is never stuck.

### What ships in the plugin

- **`skills/html-skills-listen/`** — Self-contained skill that sets up server mode. Bundles `server.js` (zero-dependency Node HTTP listener on an ephemeral port; emits each submission as a JSON-RPC line on stdout) and `scripts/listen.sh` (self-locating bash that handles startup, idempotency, and stale-session cleanup). The skill's SKILL.md instructs Claude to run the script, arm a `Monitor` on its log, and return the URL to the parent skill.
- **`assets/submit-handler.js`** — The two-mode submit JS, inlined into every interactive artifact via copy-paste from the SKILL block. Picks server vs clipboard based on whether `window.__CLAUDE_SUBMIT_URL__` is set; never probes the network speculatively.
- **`skills/html-skills-stop/`** — Paired teardown skill. Runs a short bash script, then stops the `Monitor` saved by `html-skills-listen` via `TaskStop`. Both setup and teardown skills detect `$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID` and short-circuit cleanly in cloud sessions.

### Where each mode works

| Environment | Server | Clipboard | Recommended setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI / IDE / Desktop (local) | ✅ | ✅ | invoke `html-skills-listen` from each interactive skill's pre-flight, inject the returned URL as `__CLAUDE_SUBMIT_URL__` in the artifact |
| Local SDK harness without `Monitor`-equivalent | ❌ | ✅ | None — submit always copies to clipboard |
| **Claude Code on the web** (`claude.ai/code`) | ❌ | ✅ | None. Generate the file, tell the user to open it locally (`claude --teleport <session-id>` is cleanest); submit copies JSON to clipboard; user pastes back at next chat turn |
| Sandboxed / no-shell agent | ❌ | ✅ | None — submit always copies to clipboard |

### Manual recipe (for non-Claude-Code harnesses)

```bash
node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/channel/server.js > /tmp/html-skills-submits.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > /tmp/html-skills-submits.pid
sleep 0.3
grep -oE 'listening on http://127\.0\.0\.1:[0-9]+/' /tmp/html-skills-submits.log | tail -1
```

The server defaults to an ephemeral port; the `grep` extracts the actual URL. Arm your live-tail equivalent on the log, filtering for `"method":"notifications/claude/channel"`. Inject `window.__CLAUDE_SUBMIT_URL__ = '<the URL grep printed>'` into the artifact. (Pin a specific port by exporting `HTML_SKILLS_CHANNEL_PORT=8788` before launching, if you prefer.)

### Standardised payload envelope

Both modes carry the same JSON, so a result-handling agent can be skill-agnostic:

```json
{
  "skill":   "html-mind-map",
  "kind":    "mind-map-tree",
  "data":    { /* skill-specific structure */ },
  "version": 1
}
```

`data` is whatever the skill's existing export already produces. The other fields are routing.

## Skill boundaries

A few skills cover adjacent territory and need explicit disambiguation. The descriptions encode these boundaries; this section documents them in one place for reviewers.

### `html-brainstorm-grid` ↔ `html-comparison-matrix`

Both deal with multiple options. The boundary is the **phase of cognition** the user is in:

| Signal in the prompt | Phase | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Candidates are NOT named ("brainstorm", "show me approaches", "what are the ways") | Generative — *create* candidates | `html-brainstorm-grid` |
| Candidates ARE named ("compare X, Y, Z" / "should we use A or B") | Evaluative — *score* candidates | `html-comparison-matrix` |

The single test: **are specific candidates named in the prompt?** If not, generate them with the grid. If so, score them with the matrix. The two skills are designed to compose — explore in the grid, then evaluate the survivors in the matrix.

### Other adjacencies (lower-risk)

- `html-svg-diagrams` is the general diagram skill; `html-architecture-diagrams` and `html-erd-explorer` are specific ones. The specific ones should win when the prompt names a system or schema.
- `html-spec-planning` and `html-research-reports` overlap on "explain X" — spec is forward-looking (what we'll build), research is descriptive (how X works).

## Untouched

The following four skills from the original catalog were left unselected and aren't here: Test Coverage Reports, Internal Documentation Hubs, Distributed Trace/Log Viewers, ADR Browser. Annotated PR Code Explainers was folded into `html-code-review` as patterns A and D.
