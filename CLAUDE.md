# agent-html-skills — conventions for Claude Code

## Versioning (required)

**Always bump the plugin version on every update — never ship changed code under the
same version string.**

- The version lives in `plugins/html-skills/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"`.
- Bump the **minor** (`x.Y.0`) for new skills or any behaviour/instruction change; bump the
  **patch** (`x.y.Z`) for small fixes (typos, tiny tweaks). Never reuse a released version.
- Update `plugins/html-skills/CHANGELOG.md` in the same change.
- After the release merges to `main`, tag it: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
  (matches the existing `v1.0.0` tag convention).
- This bump is also load-bearing for **skills.sh**: it re-audits a skill only when the
  version string changes, so bumping is what refreshes the security badges.
- Do **not** confuse this with the submit-payload `version: 1` inside the interactive
  skills' `SKILL.md` / `submit-handler.js` — that is the JSON envelope schema version and
  is unrelated to the plugin release version.
